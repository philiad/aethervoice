Dialer for VoIP and PSTN Calls.

Most of the codes here are from open source projects.

We got the VoIP code from SIPDROID http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/.

We got the import export contacts from VCARD(IMPORT/EXPORT CONTACTS) http://code.google.com/p/vcardio/.

We got memo pad sliding drawer from ANDROID MISC WIDGETS http://code.google.com/p/android-misc-widgets/.
